	1.	What’s SQL? MySQL? And what’s a relational database?
SQL is the language we use to talk to databases. MySQL is one of the popular systems that runs on SQL. A relational database organizes info into tables, making it easy to connect related data, like linking customers with their orders.
	2.	What’s normalization in SQL?
Normalization is all about tidying up data. It’s the process of structuring things to cut out duplicates and keep things organized, so everything’s easy to manage and there’s no mess.
	3.	What’s a primary key vs. a foreign key?
A primary key is a unique ID for each row in a table. A foreign key, on the other hand, is a way to link one table to another—like connecting an “orders” table to a “customers” table.
	4.	What are the three types of relationships?
	•	One-to-One: One record in a table connects to one record in another.
	•	One-to-Many: One record connects to many in another table, like a single customer with multiple orders.
	•	Many-to-Many: Multiple records link to multiple records, like students and classes where each student can be in many classes and each class has many students.
	5.	What’s the difference between a left join and an inner join?
A left join gives you everything from the left table, even if there’s no match on the right. An inner join only gives you rows where there’s a match in both tables.
