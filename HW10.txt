1. What are PDOs? What is a DSN?

.env file is where we use to keep sensitive data info like database passwords or API keys. 
.gitinore file tells git to track these files.

3. Should you ever upload passwords of any kind to github?

4. What is SQL injection?
SQL injection is when a hacker runs malicious codes in the database. 

5. What are prepared statements? How can we pass variables to a prepared statement
Prepared statements are like a safer way to run SQL queries. They let you write the query first with placeholders (like :username) and then pass in the actual values separately.  This makes it impossible for hackers to inject malicious codes because the database knows it’s just data, not a command.
